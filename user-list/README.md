# Simple User List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Table
As a component, the User Table is designed as a `component` named `UserTable`, located in `component/UserTable.js`

`UserTable` accept `dataSource` as it's displayed data on the table. The accepted data format is like:

```js
const dataSource = [{
    key: '1',
    name: 'John Brown',
    age: 32,
    email: 'Person1@test.com',
    address: '123 Main St, Springfield',
}];
```

## User Details Modal
When we click on element on `UserTable`, a UserDetail Modal will pop up on the website.
The user's detail information is also designed as a `component` named `User`, located in `component/User.js`

`User` accept `userRecord` as it's displayed data. The accepted data format is like:
```js
const userRecord = {
    key: '1',
    name: 'John Brown',
    age: 32,
    email: 'Person1@test.com',
    address: '123 Main St, Springfield',
};
```

## Mock Data
We created 5 mock data in `App.js`. It will be displayed when start the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
